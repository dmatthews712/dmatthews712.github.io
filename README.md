# Danielle Matthews

As a 2012 BS in Graphic Designer graduate from The Art Institute of Pittsburgh, I began my professional career working with clients in a studio setting while in college.

My background includes working with start-ups, small businesses, non-profits and religious organizations, higher education, healthcare, and Fortune 500 companies alike.

I've worked primarily as an Art Director, managing and leading a mid-sized team of designers, video producers, and web developers in a fast paced environment.   It is my ultimate goal to one day open my own agency to provide creative marketing solutions to small and large businesses, including brand strategy, web development, and digital marketing.'

Currently, I am pursuing skills in coding so that I can extend this service to future employers and clients to make me a more valuable asset, as well as be able to understand and troubleshoot issues I've run into this far into my career when it comes to code.

I can design for anything.  View my [portfolio](http://dmatthews.design) to see some of my work.  View my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielle-matthews-550baa47/).

When not working, I enjoy spending time with my family :heart: and making music :musical_note:
